Software Design Documentation for The Gaming Room

Client Overview & Software Requirements
The Gaming Room is a client aiming to develop a cloud-based version of their existing game, "Draw It or Lose It." Currently, the game functions as a single-instance application and requires adaptation for a scalable, multi-platform environment. The objective is to design software that allows multiple teams to participate in the game simultaneously, ensuring consistent experiences across various devices and operating systems. The client seeks a design that supports cloud deployment, improves performance, and maintains data integrity.

Strengths in Documentation Development
One of the strongest aspects of my work on this documentation was the thoroughness of the architectural design and technology selection. I carefully outlined how cloud computing, containerization, and microservices could enhance the game’s scalability and efficiency. Additionally, I ensured that the document was structured logically, making it easy for stakeholders to follow the rationale behind design decisions.

Value of the Design Document in Development
Working through the design document was incredibly useful in laying a solid foundation before jumping into coding. It helped clarify system components, data flow, and dependencies early in the process, reducing the likelihood of major changes later. The document also served as a communication tool, ensuring alignment between stakeholders, developers, and project managers.

Areas for Improvement & Revision
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would enhance the user experience (UX) considerations in the design. While I focused on backend architecture and system efficiency, I could have included more details on the user interface (UI) and user interactions. A more detailed wireframe or mockup would help visualize how users navigate the game.

Interpreting & Implementing User Needs
Understanding the user’s needs was central to my design approach. By analyzing the game’s current functionality and considering how users engage with it, I was able to design a solution that supports real-time gameplay, multi-user access, and cloud-based storage. Prioritizing user needs ensures a seamless gaming experience, which is essential for user retention and satisfaction.

Approach to Software Design & Future Strategies
I approached the software design using modular architecture and cloud-first principles, ensuring that the game could scale efficiently. I leveraged industry best practices such as:
•	Microservices architecture to separate game logic, user authentication, and data management.
•	Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) to enable portability and ease of deployment.
•	Event-driven processing enhances real-time interactivity.
In future projects, I would incorporate prototyping and iterative design reviews earlier in the process. Additionally, I would use user stories and personas to better align the design with end-user expectations.
